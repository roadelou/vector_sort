# Sorted Vector

This repository contains the code for the implementation of a classical exercise
in C++. The goal is to implement an object which sorts its elements
automatically.

I wanted to do this because I have never done that much C++, and since I might
need it soon I wanted to get a better grasp of the language. In this repository
I tried to follow the spirit of the language as much as possible, so I didn't
use any C code. I also purposefully didn't use the auto keyword, since it would
have made it harder to grasp what is going on.

This codebase uses several elements of the C++ language:
 - Templates,
 - Vectors, arrays and iterators,
 - Inheritance, in particular with an abstract class here,
 - Unique\_ptr,
 - Time manipulations,
 - IO manipulations,
 - Error handling with optional,
 - Some lambda functions,
 - Random number generation (although I have done a poor job here :slightly_smiling_face:).

The codebase also contains an implementation of insertion and merge sorts.
